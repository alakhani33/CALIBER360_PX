"This appointment took around 9 months to schedule, which is ridiculous.  The clinic contacted me initially to tell me they had a referral but no appointments for over six months, but would contact me when they did.  They didn't contact me, but I was able to call back and make an appointment months in advance.",Mixed,Wait Time,0,10/19/2024,X/Twitter,Competition
"I was told there were NO Cardiologist in the UC Davis Medical system who were accepting new patients.  Schedulers had no doctor where to assign me, nor even a waiting list.  Eventually, about 2 months later I received a call from a scheduling person to offer me an appointment. That was a welcome phone call!!!",Mixed,Referral,0,11/20/2024,Google,Competition
"There has been substantial improvement in the MyChart application and video visits interface and process.However, there is a lot of redundancy for Pre-Check In when a client has multiple appointments at regional clinics where the process has to be completed for the boiler plate components over and over again.",Mixed,Other (Improvement in Digital Platform/Process),0,11/30/2024,Google,Competition
But I am not happy with my visit as I found out UC Davis and Anthem Blue Cross are thinking of themselves and not the patients. My work doesn't offer me any medical Insurance which allows UC Davis medical group. Now I have to pay 4x for my family to stay with the doctors we have built good relationships with.,Mixed,Insurance,0,7/29/2024,Google,Competition
